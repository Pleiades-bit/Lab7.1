  <h1>Planetary Fact Sheet</h1>
  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <div class="explanation">
    <p><span class="earth">Earth</span> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.</p>
    <p><span class="earth">Earth</span>'s atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78.08%) and oxygen (20.95%), with trace amounts of other gases. The planet's surface is 71% water, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands.</p>
    <p><span class="mars">Mars</span> is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. <span class="mars">Mars</span> has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen or water vapor. The planet features the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system, and its surface temperatures and conditions are much colder and drier than <span class="earth">Earth</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="saturn">Saturn</span> is the sixth planet from the Sun and is best known for its prominent ring system, which is made up of ice and rock particles. It is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. <span class="saturn">Saturn</span> has a low density and is the second-largest planet in the solar system. It has dozens of moons, including Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.</p>
    <p><span class="neptune">Neptune</span> is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane, which gives it a striking blue color. <span class="neptune">Neptune</span> has strong winds and storms, including the fastest winds recorded in the solar system. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest.</p>
